# Login app documentation

## Description

When you login to Keycloak with login-app, it will display links to another projects where authenticating with Keycloak is possible.
Then you can go to Recruitzilla and click "Log in with Keycloak" and it will log you into Keycloak and to Supabase through Keycloak without the need to type your credentials.

If you login in Recruitzilla with Keycloak and then go to login-app, you will be automatically logged in with login-app.
Login-app only uses Keycloak for logging in and keycloak-js initialized Keycloak client and checks for SSO.

Currently Recruitzilla does not use keycloak-js. Even if it did, it would not automatically sign into Supabase through Keycloak without clicking a button.
Keycloak-js also refreshes the page twice which does not add to the user experience.

## Notes
Recruitzilla uses Supabase for authentication. Keycloak is just one way to get authenticated with Supabase.
If Keycloak session is terminated (e.g. with admin console), user will still stay logged in in Recruitzilla. We could use keycloak-js method logout() to terminate Keycloak session in Recruitzilla if we wanted to.

## Some more info
OIDC has different flows that can be used. Authorization Code Flow is for browser-based applications like SPAs (Single Page Applications) or server-side applications.
