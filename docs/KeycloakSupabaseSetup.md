# Keycloak with Supabase setup
Guide: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-keycloak 

NOTE: might not work in Docker/locally

## Steps:
- Login as admin in e.g. http://localhost:8080 where Keycloak is setup
- Create realm, define name for the realm
    - Realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles and groups
    - Isolated from one another and can only manage users they control
- Create user in Users tab
    - Add username
    - Go to credentials -> set password and set Temporary: Off
    - Login as user in http://localhost:8080/realms/{realm-name}/account/ 
    - On first login you have to setup email, first name and last name if not already set
- Create client from Clients tab
    - Type: OpenID Connect
    - ID: id for the client
    - Client authentication ON for OIDC confidential access type, OFF for OIDC public access type (OFF for client-side applications / frontend)
    - Authentication flow should include Standard flow (OpenID Connect redirect based authentication with authorization code)
- Valid redirect URIs should include Supabase callback URL
    - In Supabase, go to Authentication -> Providers -> KeyCloak
    - Copy-paste Callback URL into KeyCloak’s Valid redirect URIs
        - Usually https://{your-supabase-url}.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
- Retrieve issuer from OpenID EndPoint configuration
    - http://localhost:8080/realms/{my_realm_name}/.well-known/openid-configuration
    - Most likely in form {ip-address}/realms/{realm-name}
- Obtain client secret
    - Credentials -> client secret
- In Supabase add client ID, client secret and realm URL (from issuer)
- Test Keycloak in Postman
    - Make POST request to {ip-addr}/realms/{realm-name}/protocol/openid-connect/token with body in x-www-form-urlencoded with content
    - client_id: {my-client-id}
    - username: {my-username}
    - password: {my-password}
    - grant_type: password 
    - On success you should receive access token and refresh token
- Test Keycloak in React
    - With supabase-js: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-keycloak 
    - OR
    - Keycloak JS adapter for client-side:
    - https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#_javascript_adapter 
        - npm install keycloak-js 
        - Can also npm install @react-keycloak/web
        - Can use example here: https://blog.logrocket.com/implement-keycloak-authentication-react/
            - Might need to omit “auth” from URLs

    - Keycloak Node.js adapter for server-side apps:

## Our Keycloak Supabase setup
In Pouta server: https://keycloak.ilab.fi:8443/
- Realm: fullstackauth
- Client: supabase
    - Type: OpenID Connect
    - ID: supabase
    - Client authentication: Off
    - Authentication flow: Standard flow, Direct access grants (change if needed)
- Valid redirect URIs & Web origins
    - https://bmfjjujhrtssdmcbnrio.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
    - http://localhost:5173/*
    - (https://www.authzilla.ilab.fi/ not implemented yet)
- Issuer from keycloak.ilab.fi:8443/realms/fullstackauth/.well-known/openid-configuration
    - https://keycloak.ilab.fi:8443/realms/fullstackauth
- Test user is test:test
- User login from https://keycloak.ilab.fi:8443/realms/fullstackauth/account/ 
- Using supabase-js library in React
- NOTE!
    - For now, client authentication is set OFF
        - If ON: Token response: 401 unauthorized, error: “unauthorized client”, error_description: “Invalid client or invalid client credentials”
        - Using backend could fix so it would be properly secure because frontend is a public client
